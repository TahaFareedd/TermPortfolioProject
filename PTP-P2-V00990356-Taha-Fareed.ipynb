    "Git is a DevOps tool that was originally developed in 2005 for source code management. Github and Gitlab both use Git, however, they include different features and capabilities. Github,<br><br> originally, was a cloud-based Git platform that would allow developers to host and monitor changes to their code. However, presently Github and Gitlab have evolved to become a <br><br>development platform which allows developers to edit, monitor, test, and deploy their code. Github, unlike GitLab, allows developers to integrate whatever apps and integrations <br><br>the developer chooses with the use of the GitHub marketplace. Gitlab on the other hand, much like GitHub, is a cloud-based DevOps platform with the same ideas as  such as <br><br>allowing developers to monitor, edit, test, and deploy their code. Developers find Gitlab attractive due to its range of features such as cloud-hosted Git repositories, <br><br>continuous integration for automated testing, robust security measures, tools for deploying applications, and various other DevOps functionalities. Github and Gitlab are <br><br>extremely similar with the features they provide, the main difference is up to the developer and how they choose to access the features provided to them.

Over my short programming career, I never used GitLab and<br><br> always used GitHub. Therefore, I tried to stray away from GitHub because as a new programmer, I did not understand how to use GitHub effectively due to the lack of structure<br><br> it provided.

    "According to the software company, TIOBE, Python, C, and Java are the three most popular programming languages. Python is an object-oriented high-level programming language with built-in<br><br> data structures, dynamic typing, and dymanic building. These features make Python one of the main languages for rapid application development. Python is popular because<br><br> of its easy-to-read syntax and it does not need a compiler; making the edit-test-debug cycle extremely fast (What Is Python? Executive Summary, n.d.). The C programming<br><br> language is a general purpose programming language that is flexible to use; C's main purpose is used for developing system applications. C has many application uses,<br><br> such as UNIX, Google, and MySQL. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network centric language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. Java's ecosystem<br><br> is thouroughly built with a warehouse full of libraries that allow programmers to save time by not building redundant functions. Despite these three languages being the<br><br> most popular, they have their differences. Java is a platform-dependent and is a compiled programming language, Python is interpreted and platform-independent, and C is a <br><br>compiled programming language that can create vastly complex systems due to its bare-boned structure. I have had a lot of experience with both Java and Python, with Java being my<br><br> most preferred. I struggle with grasping the concepts of C due to it having a perceived stripped understanding. After taking the first half of SENG-265, I have realized the<br><br> importance of C in software development, it has encouraged to pursue a further understand of the language in hopes of one day furthering my progress in computer science.

    "Python is the most popular language in the world and there are many different concepts within Python that are important to understand. There are four different comprehensions in python:<br><br> list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, set comprehensions, and generator comprehensions (GeeksforGeeks, 2018). List comprehension is a cultivating way to create new<br><br> lists by shortening the syntax of creating new lists. List comprehensions may contain singular or mulitple if statements within the program, this in turn leads to nested list comprehensions. For<br><br> example, if you have a list of ten numbers in ascending order <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]</code>the list comprehensions create a new list with even numbers. After the program runs, the result list will appear as: <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The Program:</b>\n",
    "<br><br><code>li = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]<br>\n",
    "resultLi = []<br>\n",
    "for i in li:<br>\n",
    "    if (i%2==0):<br>\n",
    "        resultLi.append(i)<br>\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Output:</b><br><br>\n",
    "<code>[2,4,6,8,10]</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary comprehension uses the idea of list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions differ by using a key/value pair. A dictionary would be in the form of <code>myDict = {1: \"soccer\", 2: \"basketball\",  3:<br><br> \"baseball\", 4: \"volleyball\"}</code>. If you want to print the word \"basketball\" from the dicitonary, you would have to use the print statement as it is shown: <code>print(myDict[2])</code>. In Code,<br><br> this would look like this:<br><br>\n",
    "<b>The Program:</b><br><br><br>\n",
    "<code>myDict = {1: \"soccer\", 2: \"basketball\",  3: \"baseball\", 4: \"volleyball\"}<br>\n",
    "print(myDict[2])</code><br><br><br>\n",
    "<b>Output:</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>basketball</code>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Set comprehension is virtually similiar to a list comprehension, excluding the fact that it uses curly brackets \"{ }\" and not square brackets \"[ ]\"; instead of creating a new list it<br><br> creates a new set. Set comprehension and list comprehension both have their different uses such as set comprehension not allowing duplicate data types. Lets<br><br> say you have a list <code>li = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]</code>, you can use list comprehension to get rid of the duplicates and create only <code>{1,2,3,4}</code>. Here is an<br><br> example of a working program that demonstrates sets: <br><br>\n",

    "<code>{1,2,3,4}</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator comprehension is almost identical to list comprehension, however, generator comprehension uses ciruclar brackets \"( )\" while list comprehension uses square brackets \"[ ]\"<br><br>. Generator comprehensions are primarily memory efficient as it does not allocate memory for the whole list but instead one by one for each element. Here's an example of creating a generator:<br><br>\n",

    "<b>The Program:</b><br><br>\n",
    "<code>li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<br>\n",
    "oddGen = (x for x in li if x % 2 != 0)<br>\n",
    "print(oddGen)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to run this code, since the generator does not allocate memory for the whole list and just adds memory as it goes, it will not print a list of only odd numbers but instead<br><br> print out a string representation of the generator object which includes the type if object and the memory address. If I wanted to print the elements in oddGen, I would<br><br> have to iterate over the generator comprehension like:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>for i in oddGen:\n",
    "        print(i)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "and it will print each element in the oddGen generator as such:\n",

    "Slicing in Python is \"a flexible tool to build new lists out of an existing list\" (Boiko & Boiko, 2021). Python supports list slicing for any sort of abstract data type (lists, stacks,<br><br> queues, etc...) and is very popular in the pandas and NumPy library (Boiko & Boiko, 2021). The syntax for list slicing is:<code>list[start,stop,step]</code> where \"start\" is the<br><br> beginning of the slice, \"stop\" is the end of the slice, and \"step\" is the every \"nth\" element of the list. For example, when you have the method \"sliceList\" where you have<br><br> the list \"li\" be <code>[1,\"hello\",2.5,3,\"seng265\",5,1.2,\"python\"]</code> and I want to turn it into<code>[1, 2.5,'seng265',1.2]</code> I would insert <code>li[0:7:2]</code>.<br><br> The code would look something like this:<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The Program</b><br><br>\n",
    "<code>def sliceList():\n",
    "        li = [1,\"hello\",2.5,3,\"seng265\",5,1.2,\"python\"]\n",
    "        li = li[0:7:2]\n",
    "        print(li)\n",

    "<b>Output:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>[1, 2.5,'seng265',1.2]</code><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python comprehension is an extremely important aspect to know if you are using the Python programming language. As a student, I have not yet learned about sets and generators in Python<br><br> prior to this term portfolio project. This lack of knowledge encouraged me to research these types of comprehensions and try to apply them to my own projects/assignments.<br><br> I hope as I further learn more about Python that I will become a much more effective programmer. <br><br>\n",

    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an extremely popular computer programming model that orgranizes programs and softwares to focus on the data and logic instead of the function and logic. OOP<br><br> is a useful program model that popular languages like Java, Python, and C++ which all focus on an object-oriented design. OOP simplifies the programming process for complex programs that are<br><br>large, complex, and routinely updated (Gillis & Lewis, 2021). Classes are a blueprint of sorts for objects that perform certain functions for certain problems. Encapsulation is<br><br> one of the fundamentals of OOP and refers to the methods that bundle and operate on a specific piece of data in a class. The main purpose of encapsulation is used to hide<br><br> values of a data object inside of a class from unauthorized users. By implementing encapsulation, it becomes difficult for unauthorized parties to gain direct access to this<br><br> data and creates a layer of security (Braunschweig, 2018).Three advantages for encapsuation are:<br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Better Control Over Class Data:</b> Helps the authors of the program achieve better control over class data by hiding the internals of the class making it harder for unauthorized resources to view the data<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Improved Code Maintainabiliity: </b> Reduces the complexity of a program by isolating the implementation details of a class making it easier to modify or update the code without affecting other parts of the program <br><br>\n",
    "<b>Increased Code Reusability: </b> Encapsulation of classes makes it simpler to reuse them in different parts of the program reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is extremely helpful and important in today's world where the majority of the popular programming languages have similiar or direct OOP programs integrated within the language. According to Half (2023), there are four<br><br> main advantages to OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <b><li>Reusability: </li></b>\n",

    "    <b><li>Maintainability: </li></b>\n",
    "    OOP has a modular structure which makes it extremely easy to update and maintain code, allowing developers to modify or update code without impacting the rest of the program<br><br>\n",
    "    <b><li>Flexibility: </li></b>\n",
    "    OOP's ability to add or remove components as needed without causing major aids with the creation of highly adaptable software.<br><br>\n",

    "Objects and class variables are all valuable pieces incorportated within Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Objects are instances of a class created with specifically designed data with their own set of<br><br> characteristics and behaviours (Doherty, 2015). Class variables are variables that are shared between all objects within a specific class. Changing the value of a class<br><br> variable in one object will change the value of that class variable for every single object within the class. Methods are functions within a class that can be called inside<br><br> of an object to perform some sort of action on a variable (Methods (OOP) | Brilliant Math & Science Wiki, n.d.). OOP is extremely powerful and helpful in the world of<br><br> programming.

One of these modules is the copy module, assignment<br><br> statements in Python do not actually copy the object but instead creates bindings between a target and an object. Mutable collections occassionaly use copy so a developer<br><br> can change one copy without changing the other (Copy — Shallow and Deep Copy Operations, n.d.). The copy module creates two different types of copies, shallow or deep.<br><br> There are two different types of functions in the copy module, .copy(x) which returns a shallow copy of x and .deepcopy(x [,memo] ) which returns a deep copy of x (Copy —<br><br> Shallow and Deep Copy Operations, n.d.). There is a difference between shallow and deep copy, however, the difference is only important when talking about compound objects<br><br> (objects that contain other objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Shallow Copy: </b> A copy of an object whose properties share the same memory references as the original \"x\" being copied\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Deep Copy: </b> A copy of an object whose properties do not share the same memory references as the original \"x\" being copied\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example showcasing the difference between deep and shallow copy:<br><br>\n",
    "<code>import copy\n",
    "    list = [1,2,[3,4]]<br>\n",
    "    shallowCopy = copy.copy(list)<br>\n",
    "    deepCopy = copy.deepcopy(list)<br>\n",
    "    list = [2][0] = 5<br>\n",
    "    print(\"Original list: \", list)<br>\n",
    "    print(\"Shallow copy list: \", shallowCopy)<br>\n",
    "    print(\"Deep copy list: \", deepCopy)\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:<br><br>\n",
    "<code>Original list:  [1, 2, [5, 4]]<br>\n",
    "Shallow copy list:  [1, 2, [5, 4]]<br>\n",
    "Deep copy list:  [1, 2, [3, 4]]<br>\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see with the shallow copy and original list, the value three got updated to five but in the deep copy the value did not get updated. This is because the elements in shallow copy uses<br><br> the same memory address as the original list, but deep copy creates new memory addresess for each element which is why the deep copy list did not get updated.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I have never had any experience with the copy module in Python, and I can not imagine many scenarios where it is useful. However, if I ever find a problem that would need to use the copy<br><br> module, I will be able to use it efficiently after researching the topic."

Type hints are extremely beneficial<br><br> to a program.
